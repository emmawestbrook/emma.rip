I’ve been sitting on this one for a couple months, but it really has come into my regular rotation, so I wanted to write a short post on it. I’ve been doing a lot of writing for my job lately and this record has served as a perfect soundtrack for that kind of focused work. Quiet and slightly melancholy late-nineties IDM, with a bit of a wonky leftfield attitude. Some of this is small and glitchy, some expansive and haunting, but it’s all a little understated. If you like the kind of brainy-and-not-too-danceable work of Seefeel or Boards of Canada, this is for you.
